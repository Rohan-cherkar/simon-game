🎮 Simon Game

A simple and interactive Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game tests the player’s memory by generating an increasing sequence of colors that must be repeated correctly.



🧠 How the Game Works

1.Press any key to start the game.

2.The game flashes a color — remember it.

3.Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

4.With every correct round, the sequence gets longer.

5.If you press the wrong button, the game ends and you must restart.
